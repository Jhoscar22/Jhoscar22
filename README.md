<h2>About Me</h2>

<p align="justify">
My name is Oscar, and I am currently studying Computer Science and Technology at ITESM in Guadalajara, Jalisco. In college I have collaborated on a React-Native app, a website made with React and Next.js, and a Vehicular traffic simulation with a Python server and Unity client (and some other coll stuff, take a look!). I worked for 6 months as an Analyst Programmer Intern at Bruscoo Venture Builder, where I coded PineScript scripts and implemented some bots using Node.js and APIs.

<p align="justify">
As part of my personal projects I have implemented and trained small ML models and am currently developing a Soccer Tournament App. On my free time I play with my Border Collie and Yorkie, I also enjoy building with legos and learning new concepts or skills. I will be attending an international exchange programme at Aschaffenburg this fall, but I will be pleased to take a job as a software developer in the meanwhile or as soon as I come back.
