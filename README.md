My name is Oscar, and I am currently studyng **Computer Engineering Technologies** at the **ITESM** in Guadalajara, Jalisco. In college I have collaborated on a _React-Native_ app, a website made with _React_ and _Node.js_, and made a server-request monitoring system in _C++_, to name a few. On my free time I like to learn new skills, such as Machine Learning with _Python_ or _SwiftUI_, _PHP_ and _Shell_ scripting. Working as an **Analyst Programmer Intern** at _Bruscoo Venture Builder_ I code _PineScript_ scripts for backtesting trading strategies and I also code bots which signal the appropiate time to place orders according to the strategy rules and the data provided by multiple _APIs_. On a personal level I have implemented and trained small ML models and made a non-published website. Some fun facts about me are that I have a Border Collie with whom I like to play and that I really enjoy building with legos.

I am looking for a job as a React Native os iOS software developer.
